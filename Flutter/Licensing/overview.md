# Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Licensing Overview

The License key registration is no longer required for Flutter from version 18.3.0.x. So, there is no need to generate or register Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter license keys in your Flutter projects. 

The Flutter controls from Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> can be used without registering the license keys.

>**Note**: If you are using Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> controls prior to version 18.3.0.x, please follow the following steps to register your license key.

## How To Register In An Application

Register the license key in the **main method** of your example and import the â€˜syncfusion_flutter_core/core.dart' library.

{% tabs %} 
{% highlight Dart %}

    // Refer the core package
    import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_core/core.dart';

    void main() { 
      // Register Syncfusion license 
    SyncfusionLicense.registerLicense("YOUR LICENSE KEY"); 
    return runApp(MyApp()); 
    }

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
