# Getting started with Flutter Chat (SfAIAssistView)

This section explains how to add the Flutter AI AssistView widget to a single Flutter application and how to use its basic features.

## Add Flutter AI AssistView to an application

Create a simple Flutter project by following the instructions provided in the [Getting Started with your first Flutter app] documentation.

**Add dependency**

Add the [`Syncfusion Flutter Chat`] dependency to your pubspec.yaml file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight dart %}

    dependencies:
      syncfusion_flutter_chat: ^x.x.x

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

>Here **x.x.x** denotes the current version of [`Syncfusion Flutter Chat`] package. It is recommended to use the latest available version from pub.dev for the best features and updates.

**Get packages** 

Run the following command to get the required packages.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight dart %}

    flutter pub get

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Import the Chat library**

Import the library using the code provided below.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight dart %}

    import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_chat/assist_view.dart';

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Initialize assist widget

Add an assist widget with the required property, [messages].

## Add placeholder to composer

To add a placeholder to the [`AssistComposer`], use the [`decoration`] property, which is of type InputDecoration. The placeholder can be added using the [`hintText`] property.

## Add placeholder to conversation area

By default, conversation messages are empty. Itâ€™s a good idea to show a message or design to indicate this. You can use the [`placeholderBuilder`] property to create a custom widget that appears in the conversation area, which can be removed once messages start coming in.

## Add action button

It represents the send button, which was not included by default. To add it, create an instance of [`AssistActionButton`] for the actionButton.

When the send button is clicked, the [`AssistActionButton.onPressed`] callback is invoked, which rebuilds the assist widget with the newly composed message.
