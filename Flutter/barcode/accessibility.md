# Accessibility in Flutter Barcodes (SfBarcodeGenerator)

## Sufficient contrast

The `SfBarcodeGenerator` [theming](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/themes) support offers a consistent and standardized look, as well as the ability to customize colors for all UI elements.

You can customize colors for the following elements:
* [Bar color](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/barcode/barcode-customization)
* [Background color](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/barcode/barcode-customization)

## Large fonts

The `SfBarcodeGenerator` automatically adjusts font size based on device settings and scales according to the `MediaQueryData.textScaleFactor`. It also allows you to change the font size of all text elements in the barcode generator.
