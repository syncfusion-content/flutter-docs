# Fast line Chart in Flutter Cartesian Charts (SfCartesianChart)

[`FastLineSeries`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/FastLineSeries-class.html) is a line chart, but it loads faster than [`LineSeries`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/LineSeries-class.html). You can use this when there are large number of points to be loaded in a chart. To render a fast line chart, create an instance of [`FastLineSeries`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/FastLineSeries-class.html), and add it to the [`series`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfCartesianChart/series.html) collection property of [`SfCartesianChart`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfCartesianChart-class.html). The following properties can be used to customize the appearance of fast line segment:

* [`color`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/CartesianSeries/color.html) - changes the color of the line.
* [`opacity`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/CartesianSeries/opacity.html) - controls the transparency of the chart series.
* [`width`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/CartesianSeries/width.html) - changes the stroke width of the line.
