# Accessibility in Flutter Circular Charts (SfCircularChart)

## Sufficient contrast

The [`SfCircularChart`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfCircularChart-class.html) [`theming`](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/themes) support offers a consistent and standardized look, as well as the ability to set the colors for all UI elements.

The customization of colors can be done for the following chart elements.
* [Chart title](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/chart-title)
* [Series palette](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/circular-series-customization#color-palette)
* [Color mapping for data points](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/circular-series-customization#color-mapping-for-data-points)
* [Shader for data points](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/circular-series-customization#gradient-and-image-shader)
* [Data label](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/datalabel)
* [Legend title](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/legend#legend-title)
* [Legend item text](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/legend#customizing-legend)
* [Series tooltip](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/circular-charts/tooltip#customizing-the-appearance)

## Large fonts

The [`SfCircularChart`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfCircularChart-class.html) font size can be adjusted automatically based on device settings and the font size scaled based on the [`MediaQueryData.textScaleFactor`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData/textScaleFactor.html). It also allows you to change the font size of all elements in Circular chart.
