# Accessibility in Flutter Funnel Charts (SfFunnelChart)

## Sufficient contrast

The [`SfFunnelChart`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfFunnelChart-class.html) [`theming`](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/themes) support offers a consistent and standardized look, as well as the ability to set the colors for all UI elements.

The customization of colors can be done for the following chart elements.
* [Chart title](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/chart-title)
* [Palette for data points](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/funnel-customization#applying-palette-color)
* [Color mapping for data points](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/series-customization#color-mapping-for-data-points)
* [Data label](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/datalabel)
* [Legend title](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/legend#legend-title)
* [Legend item text](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/legend#customizing-legend)
* [Series tooltip](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/tooltip#customizing-the-appearance)
* [Selected segments](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/funnel-chart/selection#customizing-the-segments)

## Large fonts

The [`SfFunnelChart`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_charts/latest/charts/SfFunnelChart-class.html) font size can be adjusted automatically based on device settings and the font size scaled based on the [`MediaQueryData.textScaler`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData/textScaler.html). And also it allows to change the font size of all elements in Funnel chart.
