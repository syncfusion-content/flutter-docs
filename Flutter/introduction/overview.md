# Introduction to Syncfusion Flutter Widgets Documentation

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> [Flutter Widgets](https://www.syncfusion.com/flutter-widgets) are a set of [advanced custom widgets and file formats packages](https://pub.dev/publishers/syncfusion.com/packages) needed to create rich and high-quality cross-platform applications in iOS, Android, and Web using a single code base. This article gives you a quick overview of how to read the Flutter widgets documentation and other help resources such as video tutorials, code examples, demos, and the knowledge base.

## How to best read this user guide

* The best way to read the user guide is to start with the Getting Started section of the documentation for the [widget or library](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/introduction/widgets-catalog) that you need. The Getting Started guide provides the needed information to write the code. This is the only section recommended for end-to-end reading before writing the code. All other information can be referred when needed. The [widgets catalog](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/introduction/widgets-catalog) section helps you find the user guide link and its package in [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/syncfusion.com/packages).
* Once you are familiar with the basics of using the widget, the next step would be to start integrating the library into your application. It is very likely that you would find a code example that resembles your intended usage scenario.
* After you have integrated the component into your application, it is likely that you would need additional information on specific features and API. Search the specific topic using the search box available at the top of the user guide.

## Additional help resources

The user guide itself has enough information to get you up and running. However, there are other valuable resources you must be aware of.

### API References

The [API reference](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/introduction/api-reference) is a valuable resource that provides detailed information on the classes and its members.

### Widget Examples

The [widgets examples section](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/introduction/widget-examples) contains the GitHub link for each widgetâ€™s codes examples. This is very useful when you want to learn by practice.

### Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base section contains responses for some of the most common questions other customers had asked in the past. You can search for topics that are not covered in the user guide.
Similar to the Knowledge Base, the [Forum section](https://www.syncfusion.com/forums/flutter) also contains responses for questions asked in the past.
