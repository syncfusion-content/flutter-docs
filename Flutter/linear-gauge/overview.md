## Key Features

* **Orientation** - The Linear Gauge can be set to vertical or horizontal orientation.
* **Axis** - The axis is a scale where a set of values can be plotted. An axis can be customized by changing the thickness and edge styles and you can also inverse the axis.
* **Labels and Ticks** - The axis elements such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks can be customized to different styles.
* **Ranges** - A range is a visual element that helps you to quickly visualize where a range falls on the axis track. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to the Linear Gauge.
* **Pointers** - A pointer is used to indicate a specific value on an axis. The widget has three types of pointers: shape marker pointer, widget marker pointer, and bar pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed and you can also add multiple pointers in the Linear Gauge.
* **Mirror Gauge** - The Linear Gauge can be mirrored.  When the [`isMirrored`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/SfLinearGauge/isMirrored.html) property is true, all the gauge elements will be rendered in mirror effect. 
* **Animation** - Animate the gauge elements in a visually appealing way, when they are load, or when their values are changed.
* **Interaction** - The shape and widget marker pointers in the Linear Gauge can be moved from one value to another by swiping or drag gestures.
