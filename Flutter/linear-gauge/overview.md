# Flutter Linear Gauge (SfLinearGauge) Overview

Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter Linear Gauge is a powerful data visualization widget designed to display data on a linear scale. It's an ideal component for crafting high-quality mobile app user interfaces that require visual representation of data along a linear axis.

## Key Features

* **Orientation** - The Linear Gauge supports both vertical and horizontal orientations, giving you flexibility in your layout design.
* **Axis** - The axis serves as a scale where values are plotted. You can customize the axis by adjusting its thickness and edge styles, and even inverse the axis direction.
* **Labels and Ticks** - Axis elements such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks can be styled in various ways to match your application's design.
* **Ranges** - Ranges are visual elements that help users quickly visualize where specific values fall on the axis track. You can add multiple ranges with different styles to enhance data visualization.
* **Pointers** - A pointer is used to indicate a specific value on an axis. The widget has three types of pointers: shape marker pointer, widget marker pointer, and bar pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed and you can also add multiple pointers in the Linear Gauge.
* **Mirror Gauge** - The Linear Gauge can be mirrored.  When the [`isMirrored`](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_gauges/latest/gauges/SfLinearGauge/isMirrored.html) property is true, all the gauge elements will be rendered in mirror effect. 
* **Animation** -  Add visually appealing animations to gauge elements when they load or when their values change.
* **Interaction** - The shape and widget marker pointers in the Linear Gauge support interactive movement through swiping or drag gestures, allowing users to change values dynamically.
