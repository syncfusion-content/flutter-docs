# How to Resolve "Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib" Error?

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer is an [FFI plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#types) that uses native code to render the PDF pages. **Java** code is used for **Android**, and **Swift** code is used for **iOS and macOS**. To run the Swift code, the runtime requires the essential Swift standard libraries present in the Runpath **“usr/lib/swift.”** If this path is missing from the **Runpath Search Paths** of the project build settings, you will face the error **"Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib."**
 
Usually, the **"usr/lib/swift"** path will be added automatically to the **Runpath Search Paths** when you add the Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer (SfPdfViewer) package and build the application. But in some cases, due to the machine-specific environment, this path doesn't get added, and so this issue occurs.
 
To overcome this issue, you are suggested to add the **"usr/lib/swift"** path to the **Runpath Search Paths** manually in the project build settings. Find and edit the **Runpath Search Paths** option by opening the project in **XCode** and then going to **Build Settings -> Linking -> Runpath Search Paths**. Please find the Runpath search path option screenshot in the following project build settings.
