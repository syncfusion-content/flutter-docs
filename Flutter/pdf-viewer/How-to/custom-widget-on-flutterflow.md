# How to Add Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> PDF Viewer Widget in FlutterFlow?

## Overview

[FlutterFlow](https://app.flutterflow.io/dashboard) enables you to create native applications using its graphical interface, reducing the need to write extensive amounts of code. Additionally, it offers the capability to include custom widgets that are not included in the default [FlutterFlow](https://app.flutterflow.io/dashboard) widget collection. This article explains how to incorporate the SfPdfViewer widget as a custom widget in [FlutterFlow](https://app.flutterflow.io/dashboard).

### Create a New Project

Navigate to the [FlutterFlow dashboard](https://app.flutterflow.io/dashboard) and click the `+ Create New` button to create a new project.

### Creating the Custom Widget

1. Navigate to the `Custom Code` section in the left-side navigation menu.
2. Click on the `+ Add` button to open a dropdown menu, then select `Widget`.
3. Update the widget name as desired.
4. Click the `View Boilerplate Code` button on the right side, represented by this icon `[</>]`.
5. A popup will appear with startup code; locate the button labeled `</> Copy to Editor` and click on it.
6. Save the widget.

### Add PDF Viewer Widget as a Dependency

1. Click on `+ Add Dependency`, a text editor will appear.
2. Navigate to [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_PdfViewer) on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) and copy the dependency name and version using the `Copy to Clipboard` option.

3. Paste the copied dependency into the text editor, then click `Refresh` and `Save`.

>**Note**: The live version of [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_PdfViewer) has been migrated to the latest version of the Flutter SDK. To ensure compatibility, check [FlutterFlow](https://app.flutterflow.io/dashboard)'s current Flutter version and obtain the corresponding version of [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_PdfViewer) by referring to the [SDK compatibility](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/system-requirements#sdk-version-compatibility).

>**Note**: If you are using an older version of a dependency instead of the latest one, remove the caret symbol (^) prefix in the version number after pasting the dependency. For example, change `^21.3.0` to `21.3.0`.

>**Note**: Since [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_PdfViewer) depends on the [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter Core](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_core) package, make sure to add it as a dependency following the same steps mentioned above.

### Import the Package

1. Navigate to the `Installing` tab on the [Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter PDF Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_PdfViewer) page. Under the `Import it` section, copy the package import statement.

### Compiling the Codes

>**Note**: The compilation progress takes 2 to 3 minutes to complete.

### Create Custom Action to Import pdf.js Script

1. Click the `+ Add` button to open a dropdown menu, then select `Action`.
2. Update the action name as desired, say `importPdfjsScript`.
3. Add the below action code to import the pdf.js script.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight Dart %}

import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:web/web.dart' as web;

Future importPdfjsScript() async {
  // Check if the platform is web
  if (!kIsWeb) return;
  // Create a script element to import pdf.js library
  final script = web.document.createElement('script') as web.HTMLScriptElement
    ..type = 'text/javascript'
    ..charset = 'utf-8'
    ..async = true
    ..src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.11.338/pdf.min.js';
  // Add the script to the head tag
  web.document.querySelector('head')!.appendChild(script);
  await script.onLoad.first.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 10));
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

4. Save the action.
5. Compile the code.
