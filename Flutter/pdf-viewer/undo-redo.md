# Undo and Redo actions on the annotations in Flutter PDF Viewer widget (Syncfusion)

If you performed any undesired actions when adding, removing, or editing annotations, you can undo and redo the action to restore the previous state. This section will go through how to undo and redo the changes made to the annotations.

For desktop platforms such as Windows, macOS, and desktop web, you can use the following shortcut keys to perform the actions.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Action & Shortcut keys</th>
<th>Windows</th>
<th>macOS</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Undo</th>
<td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>z</code></td>
<td><code>Command</code> + <code>z</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Redo</th>
<td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>y</code></td>
<td><code>Command</code> + <code>y</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

You can perform the undo and redo operations in the `SfPdfViewer` by assigning the `UndoHisotyController` instance to the `undoController` property of the `SfPdfViewer`. The UndoHistoryController class contains the `undo` and `redo` methods to perform the undo and redo operations, respectively. The `canUndo` and `canRedo` properties are used to check whether the undo and redo operations can be performed, respectively. The following code example illustrates how to perform the undo and redo operations programmatically in the `SfPdfViewer` with the help of the UndoHistoryController class.

final UndoHistoryController _undoController = UndoHistoryController();

  return MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(actions: [
        ValueListenableBuilder(
            valueListenable: _undoController,
            builder: (context, value, child) {
              return IconButton(
                onPressed:
                    _undoController.value.canUndo ? _undoController.undo : null,
                icon: const Icon(Icons.undo),
              );
            }),
        ValueListenableBuilder(
            valueListenable: _undoController,
            builder: (context, value, child) {
              return IconButton(
                onPressed:
                    _undoController.value.canRedo ? _undoController.redo : null,
                icon: const Icon(Icons.redo),
              );
            }),
      ]),
      body: SfPdfViewer.network(
        'https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/PDFViewer/flutter-succinctly.pdf',
        undoController: _undoController,
      ),
    ),
