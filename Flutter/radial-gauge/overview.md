## Key Features

* **Axes** - The radial gauge axis is a circular arc that displays a set of values along a linear or custom scale based on your design requirements. Axis elements such as labels, ticks, and axis lines can be easily customized with built-in properties to match your application's theme.
* **Ranges** - Gauge ranges are visual elements that help users quickly visualize where a value falls on the axis. Text can be easily annotated within ranges to improve readability and provide additional context to your data visualization.
* **Pointers** - Pointer is used to indicate values on an axis. Radial gauge has four types of pointers: needle pointer, marker pointer, range pointer, and widget pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed.
* **Pointer Animation** - The Radial Gauge provides visually appealing animations when pointers move from one value to another. Various animation types and customization options are available to create engaging user experiences.
* **Pointer interaction** - Interactive functionality allows users to drag pointers from one value to another, enabling real-time value changes and user input directly through the gauge interface.
* **Annotations** - Add multiple widgets such as text, images, or custom Flutter widgets as annotations at specific points of interest in the radial gauge to provide additional context or information.
