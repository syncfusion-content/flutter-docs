# Accessibility in Flutter Spark Charts

## Sufficient contrast

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter Spark/Micro charts widget [`theming`](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/themes) support offers a consistent and standardized look, as well as the ability to set the colors for all UI elements.

The customization of colors can be done for the following chart elements.
* [Axis](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/axis-types)
* [Chart types](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/sparkcharts-types)
* [Special points](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/sparkcharts-types#winloss-sparkline-chart)
* [Plot band](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/plotband)
* [Trackball](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/trackball)
* [Marker](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/marker-datalabel)
* [Data label](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/sparkcharts/marker-datalabel)

## Large fonts

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter Spark/Micro charts widget font size can be adjusted automatically based on device settings and the font size scaled based on the [`MediaQueryData.textScaleFactor`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData/textScaleFactor.html). It also allows you to change the font size of all elements in Spark chart.
