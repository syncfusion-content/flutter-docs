# Flutter Treemap (SfTreemap) Overview

Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> Flutter Treemap is a powerful and customizable widget that allows you to create interactive treemaps in Flutter applications. It offers a rich feature set including selection, legends, labels, tooltips, color mapping, and more.

### Features

* **Layouts** - Utilize various layouts based on algorithms such as squarified, slice, and dice to represent both flat and hierarchically-structured data.

* **Hierarchical support** - Besides flat structures, the treemap supports hierarchical data. Each tile is a rectangle filled with smaller rectangles representing sub-data.

* **Labels** - Add widgets, like text widgets, to enhance the readability of individual tiles by providing brief descriptions on labels.

* **Selection** - Select tiles to highlight them and perform specific functionalities like displaying a pop-up or navigating to a different page.

* **Legend** - Use different legend styles to provide information on the treemap data clearly.

* **Colors** - Customize tile colors on the treemap based on levels. Tile color can be set for specific values or ranges of values.

* **Tooltip** - Use customizable tooltips to display additional information about the tiles on the treemap.

* **Custom background widgets** - Add custom widgets, such as image widgets, as backgrounds of the tiles to enrich the UI and easily visualize the data type that a particular tile represents.
